1. Create intervals in the JavaScript file to make the clocks tick.

2. Use CSS transform rotation to rotate the hands of the clock.

3. Change CSS values in JavaScript by getting reference to them through the 
DOM and setting a new value to their CSS properties:

4. It would be useful to define functions that convert seconds, minutes and hours 
to how many degrees the hand should be rotated around the clock!

5. Use JavaScripts Date objects to display the actual time.

6. Get now by declaring a new Date object. You can google for "MDN date methods" to 
see what helpful methods are attached to Date objects. 
There's helpful things like .getMonth(), .getSeconds() and who knows what else!
